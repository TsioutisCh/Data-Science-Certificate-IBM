## Winning the Space Race with Data Science
Project background:
This project is focused on the analysis of SpaceX Falcon 9 rocketâ€™s first stage. SpaceX designed the
rockets in a way that the first stage can be recycled and reused in future procedures. The first stage
of the rocket after the launch can land back to earth and be reused.

Problem:
The ability to reuse the first stage of the rocket launch puts SpaceX ahead of the competition due to
the fact that the cost of production is reduced significantly. Although the recycling of the first age is
a revolutionary development, the first stage does not always successful. Our goal is to examine the
factors that affect the success of the landing and deploy models that predict with accuracy the result
of the launching.
